# Automata-Visualization-Bridging-Theory-and-Practice
This final year project implements an AI-powered platform for visualizing automata such as NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automata) and DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata). It combines AI-generated content, interactive visualizations, and a responsive web interface to help students and educators understand automata concepts more intuitively.

Key Features

AI-Powered Content Generation: Uses Gemma/T5 models to generate explanations and automata examples.

Interactive Visualization: Allows users to create, view, and interact with NFA and DFA diagrams.

Web-Based Frontend: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive UI.

Database Management: Uses PostgreSQL to store user data, automata definitions, and generated content.

Educational Tool: Bridges theory and practice by making abstract concepts tangible and interactive.

Tech Stack

Python, Gemma/T5 (AI Models), Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, JavaScript

Use Cases

Educational tool for learning and teaching automata theory.

Generates examples and visualizations for NFAs and DFAs automatically.

Helps students understand complex theoretical concepts through interactive practice.
